This is a simple recipe app, it allows users to search for a food by name, categories (only french, and canadian food are available). 

I use data from 'TheMealDB' IPA. 

This app is basicaly design for mobile format but you can still use it with your computer, but with your computer it will show some empty space to the left and right of the page. 

Here is the demo: https://github.com/Katotodan/Recipe_app.git
